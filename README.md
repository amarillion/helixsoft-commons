helixsoft-commons
=================

A bunch of useful java utility classes that I'm re-using between multiple projects

What is here?
=============

At the moment, the utilities are divided in three broad categories:

* nl.helixsoft.util: which contains the packages
** nl.helixsoft.recordstream: for mangling tabular data, such as 
   tab-delimited files and database records
** nl.helixsoft.util: mixed bag
* nl.helixsoft.xml: simple xml and html generator
* nl.helixsoft.gui: a bunch of GUI methods
* nl.helixsoft.misc: a bunch of Utility classes with unusual dependencies
	
Where is this code used?
========================

It may be helpful to see living examples of this code in action.
This code is being used

* By various plugins of PathVisio (http://www.pathvisio.org)
* By Dr. Higgins (http://www.helixsoft.nl/project_page.php?file_name=higgins.proj)
