/**
 * Classes for treating data as a stream of records. Data from some source (e.g. a file, a database, a triplestore) is read and processed one by one. This approach can handle large datasets with minimum memory usage. 
 * 
 * Some of the classes in this package will be obsoleted by Java 8, for example {@link nl.helixsoft.recordstream.Predicate}, 
 * {@link nl.helixsoft.recordstream.Function}, {@link nl.helixsoft.recordstream.Supplier} and {@link nl.helixsoft.recordstream.Stream}.
